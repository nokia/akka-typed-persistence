# Akka Typed Persistence

**Event sourcing for Akka Typed**

This library implements actor persistence for
[Akka Typed](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.11/scala/typed.html)
with event sourcing. It provides:

* an actor definition API, which
    * is integrated with Akka Typed,
    * statically _type safe_,
    * and _supports actor persistence_ (with event sourcing and snapshots);
* and an _implementation_ of this API
    * based on `akka-typed` and `akka-persistence`.

A conference talk introducing the library was presented at
[Scala By the Bay](http://sched.co/7iUT) ([slides](https://t.co/IsENEuxShc)).
